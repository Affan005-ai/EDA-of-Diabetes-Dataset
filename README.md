🩺 Diabetes Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a diabetes dataset.
The main objective is to explore data patterns, handle missing values, visualize relationships, and gain insights into features that influence diabetes prediction.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

Pregnancies – Number of times pregnant

Glucose – Plasma glucose concentration

Blood Pressure – Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

Skin Thickness – Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin – 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI – Body mass index (weight in kg / height in m²)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction – Diabetes pedigree function

Age – Age in years

Outcome – Class variable (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – For correlation/statistical analysis

📊 Analysis Performed
✔ Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
✔ Encoding categorical variables into numerical form
✔ Summary statistics of features
✔ Distribution plots (histograms, density plots)
✔ Correlation Heatmap
✔ Boxplots for outlier detection
✔ Comparison of features with respect to diabetes outcome
